# Happy or Sad


## Description

Thanks to this project I could combine my knowledge from two areas: machine learning and web development. The whole application is written in React using TypeScript and Redux, but the engine that drives it is TensorFlow.js - a modern library for training and deploying machine learning models. You can find a working app here or play with it on your computer.
